## Setup
Clone this repository
```
git clone git@github.com:Bnanan-Labs/cube-registration-admin-service.git
```

### 1-command setup
If you just want to get going, you can setup the application with
```
bash ./setup.sh
```

That's it, you should be ready to go now! ðŸš€

### Manual setup
Same as the setup.sh, but here you get to run the commands yourself.

Install dependencies through Docker
```
docker run --rm \
    -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
    -w /var/www/html \
    laravelsail/php81-composer:latest \
    composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```

Create a local .env file
```
cp -p .env.example .env
```

Set application key
```
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate
```

Starting up Sail
```
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

Setting up Database
```
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed EuroSeeder
```

That's it, you should be ready to go now! ðŸš€

## Usage
I can highly recommend setting up following alias'
```
alias sail="./vendor/bin/sail"
alias stan="./vendor/bin/sail php ./vendor/bin/phpstan"
```

### Running the application
You can start up the application through Sail. You can decide whether you want the docker-compose to run in the 
foreground (log entries will be directed to StdOut for you to see) or let it run in the background to continue using your 
terminal
```
# runs in the foreground
sail up

# runs in the background
sail up -d
```

### Tests
You can run the full test suite with
```
sail artisan test
```

You can also specify specific tests filtered by a search string with the `--filter` option
```
sail artisan test --filter staff
```

### Migrations
You can run migrations with
```
sail artisan migrate
```

or if you want to build the database from scratch
```
sail artisan migrate:fresh
```

If you want to create a new migration use
```
sail artisan make:migration create_{table_name}_table
```
